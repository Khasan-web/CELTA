						1. What is CELTA?
					</h4>
					<div class="collapse show" id="faq1">
						<div class="answer my-0">
							<p>
								If you want to become an English language teacher and are looking for an internationally recognised teaching qualification,
								the Certificate in English Language Teaching to Speakers of Other Languages (CELTA) is ideal. CELTA is an initial
								qualification for people with little or no previous teaching experience and helps to open up a whole host of exciting
								teaching opportunities around the globe.

						2. Is CELTA a TEFL qualification?
					</h4>
					<div class="collapse" id="faq2">
						<div class="answer my-0">
							<p>
								'TEFL' or 'TESOL' are general terms sometimes used to refer to qualifications for English language teachers. CELTA is the
								best known and most widely taken initial 'TEFL' qualification of its kind in the world. The Trinity Cert TESOL is
								another equivalent qualification, but other on-line or 'introductory' courses do not carry the same level of recognition
								worldwide.

						3. Who recognises CELTA?
					</h4>
					<div class="collapse" id="faq3">
						<div class="answer my-0">
							<p>
								CELTA is accepted and respected throughout the world by organisations that employ English language teachers. The Cambridge
								CELTA has been accredited by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) at level 5 on the National qualifications
								Framework. Cambridge ESOL also works with international ELT organisations to ensure the acceptance of CELTA globally.

						4. What is CELTA on-line?
					</h4>
					<div class="collapse" id="faq4">
						<div class="answer my-0">
							<p>
								Cambridge have recently introduced this mode of delivery and some centres have started offering CELTA on-line. Despite its
								name, you do still have to do the teaching practice face to face in a designated centre. However, the input is delivered
								on-line. At the present time, Edu-Action does not offer this option. The final qualification is the same whichever
								delivery mode you choose.

						5. Who is CELTA for?
					</h4>
					<div class="collapse" id="faq5">
						<div class="answer my-0">
							<p>
								You may be looking to begin a long-term career in English language teaching and see CELTA as a springboard into a good teaching
								post in the country of your choice. You may be a graduate looking for a qualification that gives you a firm grounding
								in the fundamentals of language teaching practice, together with the confidence to take control in the classroom.
								Perhaps you want the opportunity to live and work abroad? You may just be looking for a way to see the world and
								live in another country for a year or two. In all these cases, CELTA is a good start. It is possible to get teaching
								work abroad with no qualifications as a native speaker, but you will find that many more opportunities are open to
								you with a recognised qualification. You may be an existing English language teacher with no formal qualifications.
								CELTA will help to sharpen your teaching practice, confirm your ability, and may even lead to internal promotion
								or a better teaching job.
							</p>
							<p>
								Whether you wish to teach English for the short or long term, CELTA gives you the training you need to help you adjust to
								a dynamic and challenging new profession.

					<h4 class="question-title" data-toggle="collapse" href="#faq6" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample">
						6. What does CELTA involve?
					</h4>
					<div class="collapse" id="faq6">
						<div class="answer my-0">
							<p>
								The CELTA course at Edu-Action is a full time course over 4 weeks with attendance at 5 days a week. The course will teach
								you the principles of effective teaching and a range of practical skills for teaching English to adult learners.
								You will have hands-on teaching practice, observe experienced teachers in the classroom and complete four practically
								focused written assignments.
							</p>
							<p>
								You will be assessed throughout the course, with no final examination. An external assessor, appointed by Cambridge ESOL,
								moderates each course. There are three components of assessment:
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>Teaching Practice</strong> - You will teach for a total of six hours, working with classes at two levels of ability.
								Assessment is based on your overall performance at the end of the six hours.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>Written Assignments</strong> - you will complete four written assignments; two on teaching and learning English at
								adult level; one on the language system of English; and one on classroom teaching.
							</p>
							<p>
								<strong>Professional Development</strong> - This component assesses your overall performance on the course.
							</p>
							<p>
								Assessment on the course is continuous and trainees are given written and oral feedback by the tutors on their teaching and
								written feedback on their assignments. Trainees also have a midcourse tutorial at which they discuss their progress.
							</p>
							<p>
								All tutors working on the course discuss each trainee's final grade and their decisions are unanimous.
							</p>
							<p>
								To be awarded the Certificate, you must pass all three components. There are three grades - Pass, Pass 'B' and Pass 'A'.
								CELTA certificates donâ€™t expire.

						7. I have heard that the course is very intensive - is that true?
					</h4>
					<div class="collapse" id="faq7">
						<div class="answer my-0">
							<p>
								Yes.
							</p>
							<p>
								You will be expected to devote five days a week to the course, from 9.00 - 5.00 and also spend a good deal of your free time
								on course-related work, perhaps 15-20 hours a week.
							</p>
							<p>Here are some comments from former trainee teachers:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>'It's a fascinating, fun and demanding course.'</li>
								<li>'Although I had been warned about the amount of work involved, I still was surprised about how demanding it was.'</li>
								<li>'I cannot remember either working so hard or enjoying a course so much.' 'The most intensive course I've ever done.'

						8. Do I have to attend all the course hours?
					</h4>
					<div class="collapse" id="faq8">
						<div class="answer my-0">
							<p>
								You are expected to attend 100% of the course. In special circumstances, for example, illness, we can make exceptions, but
								if more than 20% is missed the certificate cannot be awarded. You must complete all 6 hours of observed and assessed
								teaching practice in order to pass the course. Please ensure that you can make this commitment.

						9. What else would I be expected to do outside the timetabled hours?
					</h4>
					<div class="collapse" id="faq9">
						<div class="answer my-0">
							<p>
								You should expect to spend time:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>- liaising with colleagues in your teaching practice group in order to produce a cohesive timetable of lessons for
									your learners.</li>
								<li>- planning your own lessons: although you may be teaching for relatively short periods it is quite normal to spend
									at least 3-6 hours preparing.</li>
								<li>- working on written assignments; four 1000 word assignments. These are course-related and practical in nature.</li>

						10. What is the course timetable?
					</h4>
					<div class="collapse" id="faq10">
						<div class="answer my-0">
							<p>
								The course is divided into methodology sessions and teaching practice with feedback. Even if you are not actually teaching
								that day you will be expected to attend teaching practice to observe your colleagues discuss their lessons with them
								and the tutors.

				<div class="question">

						11. What happens in the methodology sessions?
					</h4>
					<div class="collapse" id="faq12">
						<div class="answer my-0">
							<p>
								A variety of activities such as discussion of tasks in groups, demonstration of teaching techniques by tutors, observation
								and analysis of teaching videos, analysis of teaching materials, peer teaching in groups and so on. There is a high
								level of trainee participation, often in pairs or groups.

						12. When would I start teaching?
					</h4>
					<div class="collapse" id="faq12">
						<div class="answer my-0">
							<p>
								In the first week of the course. At the beginning of the course we just want you to 'have a go'. As you receive input from
								the methodology sessions and from feedback on your teaching and that of your colleagues, you will be expected to
								try and put this into practice. A lot of your learning will be through trial and error.

				<div class="question">
					<h4 class="question-title" data-toggle="collapse" href="#faq13" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample">
						13. Who would I be teaching?
					</h4>
					<div class="collapse" id="faq13">
						<div class="answer my-0">
							<p>
								Groups (between 10-12) of adult foreign learners. They are all volunteers and are aware that you are trainees.

				<div class="question">
					<h4 class="question-title" data-toggle="collapse" href="#faq14" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample">
						14. What is feedback?
					</h4>
					<div class="collapse" id="faq14">
						<div class="answer my-0">
							<p>
								Feedback refers to the time after teaching practice when you have the opportunity to reflect upon and discuss your teaching
								with your colleagues (there are usually six trainees in each teaching practice group) and one of the tutors. This
								part of the course is extremely important because it should help you to develop an increasing awareness of your strengths
								and weaknesses as a teacher.

				<div class="question">
					<h4 class="question-title" data-toggle="collapse" href="#faq15" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample">
						15. What teaching method would I be expected to use?
					</h4>
					<div class="collapse" id="faq15">
						<div class="answer my-0">
							<p>
								No one 'method' is taught on the course: It is an introduction to the theory and practice of Teaching English as a Foreign
								Language and introduces trainees to a variety of current procedures and techniques in the field.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>

				<div class="question">
					<h4 class="question-title" data-toggle="collapse" href="#faq16" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample">
						16. If I pass the course will I be able to find work easily?
					</h4>
					<div class="collapse" id="faq16">
						<div class="answer my-0">
							<p>
								This depends on where you want to work. If you want to work overseas, it's easy to find work almost anywhere. In most countries
								you can expect to earn enough to have a good standard of living in that country, but probably not to save much. In
								the Middle East and Far East it's possible to make good money but note that work permits in these countries are only
								given to people who have a degree (this does not have to be in English or a related teaching subject). You will be
								given some help and advice while on the course, though Edu-Action does not provide a job placement service as such.
							</p>
							<p>
								It is generally difficult for newly qualified teachers to find work in the UK, EU, US. It is possible, but it is very likely
								to be part-time and hourly paid (ie no work/ money during school holidays etc). Getting a contract is very difficult.
								If you want to work in the UK, CELTA is a good initial qualification, but you will need to do further study to get
								Qualified Teacher Status. This may be a PGCE, a Cert Ed or a DET. It is possible to study for these whilst you are
								working in a teaching job.

				<div class="question">
					<h4 class="question-title" data-toggle="collapse" href="#faq17" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample">
						17. I don't have a degree: will this be a problem?
					</h4>
					<div class="collapse" id="faq17">
						<div class="answer my-0">
							<p>
								In some countries, especially in the Middle East and Far East, a degree is required in order to get a work permit. Other
								countries will accept you without one. You are advised to consult individual embassies for accurate information and
								advice.

				<div class="question">
					<h4 class="question-title" data-toggle="collapse" href="#faq18" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample">
						18. Am I eligible to apply?
					</h4>
					<div class="collapse" id="faq18">
						<div class="answer my-0">
							<p>
								Ideally you should:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Have a standard of education equivalent to that required for entry into higher education</li>
								<li>Be aged over 18 or over</li>
								<li>Have a 'near native' standard of English. This will mean that you can produce 'virtually error-free' written and
									spoken English. (C1 English level â€“ recommended minimum IELTS 7).</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								You may still be accepted if you do not have formal qualifications at this level but can demonstrate that you would be likely
								to complete the course successfully.

					<h4 class="question-title" data-toggle="collapse" href="#faq19" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseExample">
						19. I am not a native speaker of English: is this course appropriate for me?
					</h4>
					<div class="collapse" id="faq19">
						<div class="answer my-0">
							<p>
								The course is open to native and non-native speakers of English and as a non-native speaker, you have the advantage of having
								made the language learning journey yourself. This is very important and useful and potentially makes you an excellent
								role model for learners. However, you will need to have a standard of English, both written and spoken, that is near
								to native speaker competence and is 'virtually error free'.
