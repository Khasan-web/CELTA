						<h3>Our teachers</h3>
						<p>Our teacher trainers are experts in their field and use a variety of effective educational methods and strategies throughout

						<h3>Real teaching experience</h3>
						<p>CELTA is taught in our schools, so you will become immersed in a real teaching environment. Teaching practice takes
							place in our classrooms, with enthusiastic people from the local community that want to improve their English (Edu-action
							offers all lessons with trainee teachers free of charge to students).</p>

						<h3 class="text-warning">Please note that the course is very intensive</h3>
						<p>Most participants tell us that they spend 2-3 additional hours at home each evening researching language, completing
							written assignments and preparing lessons. This course provides you with a basic toolkit for teaching English and
							covers a lot of ground; although we look at some language analysis, and tutors will support you, the assumption is
							that you will research grammar and language issues for lessons outside the sessions.</p>

						<p>You should ensure that you do not have other time consuming commitments during the course and are in good physical
							and mental health before embarking on the CELTA. </p>
